## Check MAC Address before the main program.


* By default, the "main" program cannot pass the MAC address check.
* To add an authorized machine, use "addSalt.exe" to generate the salt-MAC-address.
* Manually add the salt-MAC-address to GLOBAL_machineMacAddr in "main.cpp"
* Then, the "main" program can pass the MAC address check.
